# Legacy Lönn Plugins
A collection of [Lönn](https://github.com/CelestialCartographers/Loenn) plugins ported from Ahorn plugins of unmaintained Celeste mods.

## Maintained plugins
Note that if a helper listed here was updated to a higher version, its new plugins aren't guaranteed to be ported in this mod. Hopefully this shouldn't happen, as the mods ported in this repository should be completely unmaintained.

__If you happen to own, or have access to a mod which you'd like to maintain, and retrieve the ported Lönn plugins from this mod, please jump to [Moving ported plugins to its original mod](#moving-ported-plugins-to-its-original-mod).__

Here is a list of helpers whose Ahorn plugins have been ported to Lönn in this mod.

- __[Contort Helper](https://gamebanana.com/mods/53701) `1.5.5`__, by @Mnstrman06 and @SSUnlimited9.

## Moving ported plugins to its original mod

If you wish to move ported plugins to your mod, please reach out in the [Mt. Celeste Climbing Association Discord](discord.gg/celeste), in the `modding_dev` channel from the MODDING category. We also have a thread open (Lönn Ports) where we bring all Lönn-porting-related discussions. Consider reaching out to one of the following members:

- `@catapillie#1927`
- `@Bigkahuna#8323`

We will remove ported plugins from this repository once your mod is updated with them.
